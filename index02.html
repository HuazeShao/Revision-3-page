      <div class="Pic1Descri"><p>Regarding to the phenomenon of the great increase of population and amount of carbon dioxide, one solution can be considered is urban agriculture, which means cultivating plants within cities. With urban agriculture, the problem of supply crisis would be allieviated. It can lower the transportation costs since it helps to balance the CO2 in atmosphere. It can also increase community bonding since multiple community members can work on planting and sharing the fruits together.</p>

      <div class="Pic2Descri"><p>Another great way of preventing the extinction of human is re-using consumption, which means treating our consumptions as resources rather than garbages. Food scraps and plants are the best composts used for farmers. Within Shanghai (China), garbage-sorting was practiced as a test-- people would sort their daily consumptions into three catergories, which are dry refuse, wet garbageï¼Œrecyclables, and harmful wastes. Such a division helped to collect much amount of wastes that could be reused. According to researched, it was introduced that there are 9200 tons of wet garbages (which could be reused as soils for growing plants) in Shanghai PER DAY. Therefore, the practice of re-using consumptions would be very effective. </p></div>

      <div class="Pic1Descri"><p>
        One of the most challenging while most effective practices for saving our own species is combating against oil companies. Oil companies produce fossil fuels, which surrounds us in everyday life. This is because we use fossil fuels to heat our homes, run our vehnicles, ower industry and manufacturing. However, there are many other alternative resources to achieve such a result, such as solar energy and wind power. Due to the dominating power of oil companies, we people had little power to influence their centralized control over fossil fuels. Instead, we can try to plant small energy-generating installations to collect other types of energy by ourselves. By doing so, we have the hope that we can detach from big companies' control. </p>
